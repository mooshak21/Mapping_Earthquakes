# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Overview
We are tasked to expand on our previous map creation by adding data associated with tectonic plates and major earthquakes. Using this data, we will create different overlays that a user can alternate between to visualize the data within each category.

## Deliverable 1 
Tectonic Plate Data:

Here we can see that we have taken the data from a JSON file that contains the locations for the [tectonic plates] (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fraxen/tectonicplates/master/GeoJSON/PB2002_boundaries.json)
